Sticky Space is a top scroller game where the player controls an astronaut which 
hops from planet to planet while avoiding dangers such as aliens while trying to
achieve a high score calculated by airtime. To run the program the user should
run main.py while also making sure that all files in the 15-112-Term-Project folder
are present. Additional intructions are available on the start screen after running
the program. The only library necessary to run the program is the cmu_112_graphics.py
library which is included within the 15-112-Term-Project folder. Finally, the only
short cut that may be helpful to the user is by pressing the key "r" which resets
the entire game. Now you're ready to play! Good luck space ranger!
